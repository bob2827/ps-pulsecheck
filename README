## NOTES

* Compiled/Tested on Ubuntu 13.10 (64bit)
* Needs a review of cross-platform compatibility
* The programs are fairly agnostic as to which order they're started in, but
  Prog 2 does not yet survive well against unexpected disconnects of the other two.
* Port and host location assumptions are concentrated in pulsecheck.h, if you
  need to change any of them to suit your platform

## TODO

* Prog 2 not properly receiving change requests to "top N" size from Prog 3
* Flush input sent to Prog 2 during the time between connections from Prog 3 and Prog 1
* Prog 2's main() needs to be refactored into 2-3 functions to increase readability
  and organization
* Make Prog 2 more resilient against runtime dis/re-connects from Prog 1&3
* Cleaner shutdown of Prog 2
* Cleanup of logging messages and compile-time debug flag for switch in/out of
   messages
* makefile doesn't properly detect changes to pulsecheck.h
