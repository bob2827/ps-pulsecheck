## NOTES

* Compiled/Tested on Ubuntu 13.10 (64bit)
* I'm not entirely sure how cross compatible this is as I have limited ability
  to test it on non-linux platforms. Should compile under cygwin if you need it
  to run on windows platforms. You might need minor syscall tweaks if moving to
  BSD or other unicies.
* There's some extra operational/debugging messaging that can be disabled by
  unsetting 'DBGINO' in the makefile.
* The programs are fairly agnostic as to which order they're started in.
* Port and host location assumptions are concentrated in pulsecheck.h, if you
  need to change any of them to suit your platform you can do so here

## TODO

* Flush input sent to Prog 2 during the time between connections from Prog 3 and Prog 1
* makefile doesn't properly detect changes to pulsecheck.h
