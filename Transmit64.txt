
Write three programs.

First program:
Open a socket and transmit 64 bit binary integers on it.

Second program:
Open two sockets, one from the first program, one to the third program.
Receive 64 bit integers from first program. Filter for top N largest values (N initially 20).
Any time a new top N value is received, transmit to third program.
If third program transmits an 8 bit unsigned value to second program on socket, use that value as new N.

Third program:
Receives stream of 64 bit integers from second program and prints them out.
About once a minute, transmit a new 8-bit N to second program.

All programs should be written to be platform independent.
You should assume that programs might run on different kinds of processors.
You can assume long long availability.

You can assume that only a single instance of each program runs at a time (no spawning necessary).

You may choose how the sockets are to be created, but listeners on ports would be best.

You may write the programs either C or C++.

First and third programs should be considered test programs.
Second program should be considered production code.

What environment did you compile/run this in?

Could you include and Makefile or VC solution files…
